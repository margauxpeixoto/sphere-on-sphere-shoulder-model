# Sphere on sphere shoulder model

This model simulates the biomechanics of the glenohumeral joint, focusing on how variations in joint congruence affect humeral head displacement and rotator cuff muscle forces. It integrates a sphere-on-sphere glenohumeral model with a Force-Dependent Kinematics (FDK) algorithm to account for humeral head displacements during shoulder movements.
